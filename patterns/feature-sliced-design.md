# Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) üß©

Feature-Sliced Design is a methodology for frontend architecture that helps organize code in large applications by dividing it into layers based on business domain rather than technical functions.

## üéØ Core Principles

Feature-Sliced Design is built on three key principles:

1. **Segregation by Scope** - Components are organized by their business domain scope rather than technical function
2. **Layer Isolation** - Higher layers can import from lower layers, but not vice versa
3. **Shared Kernel** - Common code is extracted to shared layers

## üîÑ Layer Structure

FSD organizes code into the following layers, from highest to lowest:

### 1. App Layer
- Application initialization
- Global providers
- Routing configuration
- Style themes

### 2. Processes Layer (deprecated)
- Complex multi-step business processes
- User flows that span multiple features
- Example: Authentication flow, Checkout process

### 3. Pages Layer
- Compositions of widgets and features
- Route-specific components
- Page-level layouts

### 4. Widgets Layer
- Complex UI blocks composed of entities and features
- Independent components that solve specific interface tasks
- Example: Header, Sidebar, ProductCard

### 5. Features Layer
- User interactions and business logic
- Implements specific user stories
- Example: "Add to cart", "Filter products"

### 6. Entities Layer
- Business entities
- Domain models with business logic
- Example: User, Product, Order

### 7. Shared Layer
- Reusable infrastructure code
- UI kit components
- Utility functions
- API interfaces

## üåü Benefits

- **Scalability** - Easily scales with team and project growth
- **Maintainability** - Clear boundaries between domains
- **Team Autonomy** - Teams can work on isolated features
- **Consistent Structure** - Common patterns across the project
- **Reduced Coupling** - Dependencies flow in one direction
- **Improved Developer Experience** - Clear place for new code

## üöÄ Implementation Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Analyze Your Domain**
   - Identify your core business entities
   - Map out key features and user stories

2. **Set Up Project Structure**
   ```
   src/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/         # Application initialization
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ processes/   # Cross-feature scenarios
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/       # Application pages
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets/     # Complex UI blocks
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/    # User interactions
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entities/    # Business entities
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/      # Shared code
   ```

3. **Define Slice Organization**
   Within each layer, organize code by business domain:
   ```
   features/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/        # Authentication feature
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/      # Components
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model/   # Business logic
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/     # API requests
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/     # Helper functions
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts # Public API
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cart/        # Shopping cart feature
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ product/     # Product features
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
   ```

4. **Enforce Import Rules**
   - Higher layers can import from lower layers
   - Slices can only import from other slices' public APIs
   - Use ESLint rules to enforce architecture

## üíª Examples

### Entity Layer Example

```typescript
// entities/product/model/types.ts
export interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
  imageUrl: string;
}

// entities/product/index.ts
export { type Product } from './model/types';
export { ProductCard } from './ui/ProductCard';
```

### Feature Layer Example

```typescript
// features/product/filter/ui/ProductFilter.tsx
import { Product } from '@/entities/product';

export const ProductFilter = ({ products, onFilter }) => {
  // Filter implementation
}

// features/product/filter/index.ts
export { ProductFilter } from './ui/ProductFilter';
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- **Over-slicing** - Creating too many small slices
- **Under-slicing** - Making slices too large and coupled
- **Wrong layer placement** - Confusing features and entities
- **Circular dependencies** - Breaking the layer hierarchy
- **Public API neglect** - Not controlling what's exported

## Recommendations
I would recommend using ESLint Feature-sliced config for your project codestyle adjustment, so your code will be standardized and it would be very hard to make mistake:

üí° **Pro Tip:** Start with a less strict implementation and gradually refine your architecture as your understanding of the business domain increases.
